# ShadowLight Network Roadmap

This roadmap outlines the intended evolution of ShadowLight Network.
It reflects design maturity rather than implementation completeness.

ShadowLight prioritizes conceptual clarity, analytical rigor,
and professional trust over rapid feature expansion.

---

## v1.0.x — Foundation (Current)

Status: Published

Focus:
- Establish project identity and intent
- Define philosophy and analytical modes
- Create documentation structure
- Set licensing and release discipline

Notes:
This phase intentionally avoids implementation details.
The goal is conceptual solidity.

---

## v1.1.x — Formalization

Focus:
- Expand documentation depth
- Define analytical workflows
- Clarify boundaries, limitations, and non-goals
- Introduce consistent terminology and references

Possible additions:
- Intended use cases
- Threat modeling perspectives
- Mode transition guidance

---

## v1.2.x — Architecture & Interfaces

Focus:
- High-level system architecture
- Conceptual interfaces between components
- Preparation for implementation work

Notes:
No commitment to specific languages, frameworks,
or deployment models at this stage.

---

## v2.0 — Implementation Phase

Focus:
- One or more reference implementations
- Tooling or modules aligned with ShadowLight principles
- Practical application in real-world scenarios

Notes:
Implementation decisions will follow,
not precede, architectural clarity.

---

## Out of Scope (For Now)

- Consumer-facing automation
- One-click solutions
- Opaque or non-explainable systems
- Claims of autonomous decision-making

ShadowLight Network is designed to support analysts,
not replace them.
