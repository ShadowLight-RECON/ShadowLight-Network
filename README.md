# ShadowLight Network

**Version:** v1.1.0  
**Status:** Active – Documentation‑First Release  
**Focus:** Conceptual, Analytical, and Structural Framework

---

## Overview

ShadowLight Network is a **documentation‑driven analytical framework** designed to explore structured reasoning, operational modes, and conceptual architectures without being tied to a specific implementation.

It serves researchers, analysts, and system designers who want to reason about **how systems think, adapt, and limit themselves**—before code is ever written.

ShadowLight prioritizes **clarity, intent, and structure** over execution.
