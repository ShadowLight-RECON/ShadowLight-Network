# ShadowLight Network

**ShadowLight Network** is a documentation‑first analytical framework designed to formalize how complex systems, behaviors, and decisions are examined, categorized, and understood.

ShadowLight is not an application, tool, or product implementation.  
It is the **underlying framework** that makes structured analytical systems possible.

> ShadowLight is the wheel — refined, intentional, and foundational.

---

## Current Release

**Version:** v1.1.0  
**Status:** Active Development (Conceptual Framework Stable)

This release solidifies ShadowLight’s core philosophy, architecture, analytical modes, and documentation structure.

---

## What ShadowLight Is

ShadowLight Network provides:

- A **structured analytical philosophy**
- Clearly defined **modes of analysis**
- A consistent **architectural mental model**
- Documentation that prioritizes **clarity, rigor, and intent**
- A foundation for future systems, tools, or implementations

ShadowLight is designed to be **understood first**, then applied.

---

## What ShadowLight Is Not

To maintain integrity and focus, ShadowLight is **not**:

- A runnable software application
- A generic AI framework
- A collection of loosely connected ideas
- An implementation‑specific system

ShadowLight intentionally separates **conceptual design** from execution.

---

## Documentation Overview

All core documentation lives in the `docs/` directory and defines the system in full.

### Included Documents

- **Philosophy & Design Principles**  
  Foundational intent, values, and guiding constraints.

- **Architecture**  
  How ShadowLight is structurally organized at a conceptual level.

- **Modes & Analytical Behaviors**  
  Distinct analytical states and how reasoning changes between them.

- **Intended Use Cases**  
  Where ShadowLight applies — and why.

- **Limitations & Non‑Goals**  
  Explicit boundaries to prevent misuse or misinterpretation.

- **Roadmap**  
  Directional evolution of the framework.

- **Versioning**  
  How changes are tracked and classified.

Each document is designed to stand on its own while reinforcing the whole.

---

## Design Philosophy

ShadowLight prioritizes:

- Precision over breadth  
- Structure over improvisation  
- Intentional limitations over unchecked expansion  
- Long‑term coherence over short‑term convenience  

Every constraint is deliberate.

---

## Contributing

ShadowLight Network welcomes **disciplined, thoughtful contributions** that improve clarity, consistency, and conceptual rigor.

All contributions are reviewed under the project’s documented philosophy and constraints.

Please read **`CONTRIBUTING.md`** before opening issues or pull requests.

## Changelog

A complete record of notable changes is maintained in **`CHANGELOG.md`**.

## License

License information is provided in the `LICENSE` file.

---

## Final Note

ShadowLight Network is designed to be **foundational**.

It is meant to outlast individual tools, implementations, and trends — providing a stable analytical core others can build upon without redefining.

If you are using ShadowLight, you are standing on its framework — and that is intentional.
