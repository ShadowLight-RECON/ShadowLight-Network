# ShadowLight Network — Intended Use Cases

## Purpose

This document defines the **intended use cases** for ShadowLight Network.

It describes **where ShadowLight provides value**, **how it is meant to be applied**, and **what kinds of problems it is designed to assist with**, without prescribing implementation details or specific tooling.

This document answers:
- *When should ShadowLight be used?*
- *What kinds of analysis does it support best?*
- *What role does it play alongside humans and systems?*

---

## Design Intent

ShadowLight Network is designed to support **complex reasoning under uncertainty**.

It is not optimized for:
- Simple lookups
- Deterministic execution
- Fully autonomous decision‑making

Instead, ShadowLight excels where:
- Information is incomplete
- Signals conflict
- Context matters
- Human judgment remains essential

---

## Core Use Case Categories

ShadowLight use cases fall into five primary categories:

1. Exploratory Sense‑Making
2. Strategic & Systems Analysis
3. Risk & Threat Assessment
4. Decision Support
5. Meta‑Analysis & Review

---

## 1. Exploratory Sense‑Making

### Description
ShadowLight assists in understanding **unfamiliar, complex, or poorly defined domains**.

### Example Scenarios
- Investigating a new technical system or architecture
- Exploring emerging trends or weak signals
- Mapping unknown problem spaces

### Value Provided
- Rapid hypothesis generation
- Pattern discovery
- Structured exploration without premature conclusions

---

## 2. Strategic & Systems Analysis

### Description
ShadowLight supports reasoning about **interconnected systems**, incentives, and long‑term effects.

### Example Scenarios
- Organizational strategy evaluation
- Network or ecosystem analysis
- Policy or governance modeling

### Value Provided
- Multi‑perspective analysis
- Identification of second‑order effects
- Stress‑testing strategic assumptions

---

## 3. Risk & Threat Assessment

### Description
ShadowLight assists in identifying **vulnerabilities, failure modes, and adversarial behaviors**.

### Example Scenarios
- Security posture reviews
- Operational risk assessments
- Red‑team or adversarial simulations

### Value Provided
- Conservative risk discovery
- Adversarial reasoning
- Exposure of hidden assumptions

---

## 4. Decision Support

### Description
ShadowLight provides structured analysis to **inform human decision‑making**, not replace it.

### Example Scenarios
- Evaluating multiple options with trade‑offs
- Clarifying decision constraints
- Exploring consequences of alternative paths

### Value Provided
- Transparent reasoning
- Option comparison
- Confidence calibration

> ShadowLight does not make decisions — it **supports better ones**.

---

## 5. Meta‑Analysis & Review

### Description
ShadowLight can analyze **analysis itself**, improving rigor and reliability.

### Example Scenarios
- Reviewing reasoning chains
- Detecting bias or overconfidence
- Validating conclusions against evidence

### Value Provided
- Error detection
- Bias awareness
- Analytical quality control

---

## Human–System Collaboration

ShadowLight is explicitly designed for **human‑in‑the‑loop operation**.

### Expected Human Roles
- Define intent and constraints
- Interpret outputs
- Make final judgments
- Apply contextual knowledge

### ShadowLight’s Role
- Surface possibilities
- Challenge assumptions
- Organize complexity
- Maintain analytical discipline

---

## Contexts of Appropriate Use

ShadowLight is well‑suited for:
- Research and investigation
- Strategic planning
- Complex problem framing
- Scenario exploration
- Review and validation workflows

---

## Contexts of Inappropriate Use

ShadowLight is **not intended** for:
- Fully autonomous control systems
- Safety‑critical real‑time execution
- Tasks requiring guaranteed correctness
- Situations where human oversight is impossible

---

## Scalability of Use

ShadowLight can be applied at:
- Individual reasoning level
- Team or organizational analysis
- Cross‑domain synthesis

Its value increases with:
- Clear intent
- Thoughtful mode selection
- Iterative human engagement

---

## Summary

ShadowLight Network is intended to be used as an **analytical partner**:

> It explores, challenges, and clarifies —  
> while humans decide, judge, and act.

This document defines the **where and why** of ShadowLight’s application, ensuring it is used deliberately and responsibly.
