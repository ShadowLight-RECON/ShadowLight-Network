# ShadowLight Analytical Modes & Behaviors

ShadowLight Network operates through defined analytical modes.
Each mode represents a distinct cognitive posture, governing
how information is explored, interpreted, and synthesized.

Modes are not features or tools — they are structured ways
of thinking applied to complex problems.

## 1. Reconnaissance Mode

**Purpose:** Broad situational awareness and surface mapping.

Reconnaissance Mode is used to understand an environment before
making assumptions. It emphasizes observation, pattern detection,
and scope definition.

**Characteristics:**
- High‑level exploration
- Identification of unknowns
- Mapping entities, relationships, and signals
- Avoids early conclusions

**Typical Use Cases:**
- Initial threat landscape assessment
- Early‑stage research into unfamiliar systems
- Problem framing and hypothesis generation

---

## 2. Analytical Mode

**Purpose:** Structured reasoning and hypothesis testing.

Analytical Mode focuses on narrowing uncertainty through
methodical examination of evidence and competing explanations.

**Characteristics:**
- Explicit assumptions
- Step‑by‑step reasoning
- Comparison of alternative hypotheses
- Emphasis on logical consistency

**Typical Use Cases:**
- Threat attribution
- Root cause analysis
- Validation or rejection of preliminary conclusions

## 3. Adversarial Mode

**Purpose:** Stress‑testing conclusions against hostile intent.

Adversarial Mode assumes deception, manipulation, or deliberate
obfuscation within the data or environment.

**Characteristics:**
- Challenges surface‑level interpretations
- Models attacker incentives and strategies
- Searches for contradictions and blind spots
- Assumes incomplete or poisoned information

**Typical Use Cases:**
- Red‑team analysis
- Disinformation assessment
- Security and intelligence investigations

---

## 4. Synthesis Mode

**Purpose:** Coherent integration of findings into insight.

Synthesis Mode consolidates fragmented observations into
a defensible narrative or decision‑support output.

**Characteristics:**
- Integration across domains
- Clarification of confidence levels
- Identification of remaining uncertainties
- Actionable framing

**Typical Use Cases:**
- Reporting and briefings
- Strategic decision support
- Knowledge transfer and documentation

## Mode Interaction

ShadowLight modes are not linear or exclusive.
Analysts may move fluidly between modes as understanding evolves.

The effectiveness of ShadowLight depends on
intentional mode selection and disciplined transitions.
