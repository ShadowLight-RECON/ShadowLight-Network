# ShadowLight Network — Conceptual Architecture

This document describes the high-level conceptual architecture
of ShadowLight Network.

The architecture defines how analytical components relate
to one another without prescribing specific implementations,
technologies, or deployment models.

---

## Architectural Overview

ShadowLight Network is organized around five conceptual layers:

1. Input & Context
2. Analytical Modes
3. Workflow Orchestration
4. Synthesis & Output
5. Governance & Boundaries

Each layer supports disciplined analytical reasoning
while preserving analyst agency.

---

## 1. Input & Context Layer

This layer represents all incoming information and framing inputs.

Examples include:
- Observations
- Data artifacts
- Analyst assumptions
- External reports
- Environmental context

This layer assumes information may be incomplete,
noisy, deceptive, or adversarial.

---

## 2. Analytical Modes Layer

This layer contains the defined analytical modes:
- Reconnaissance
- Analysis
- Adversarial
- Synthesis

Modes govern *how* information is processed,
not *what* conclusions are reached.

Modes are intentionally discrete to encourage
explicit cognitive posture selection.

---

## 3. Workflow Orchestration Layer

This layer describes how modes are combined
into repeatable analytical workflows.

Responsibilities include:
- Mode sequencing
- Iteration and re-entry
- Context preservation across transitions

Workflows remain flexible and analyst-driven,
not automated pipelines.

---

## 4. Synthesis & Output Layer

This layer focuses on translating analysis into insight.

Outputs may include:
- Narrative explanations
- Confidence assessments
- Identified uncertainties
- Decision-support artifacts

This layer emphasizes clarity, traceability,
and defensibility over presentation polish.

---

## 5. Governance & Boundaries Layer

This layer enforces:
- Intended use constraints
- Ethical boundaries
- Non-goals and exclusions
- Analyst accountability

It ensures ShadowLight remains aligned
with its stated philosophy and purpose.

---

## Architectural Principles

- Analyst-in-the-loop at all times
- Explainability over automation
- Flexibility over rigidity
- Conceptual clarity before implementation

This architecture serves as a reference point
for all future design and implementation decisions.
