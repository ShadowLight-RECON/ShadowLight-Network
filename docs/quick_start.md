# ShadowLight Quick Start

This guide explains how to use **ShadowLight Network** as a first‑time user.

ShadowLight is a **conceptual and analytical framework**, not a software application.
You do not install or execute it — you **apply it to your thinking**.

---

## What ShadowLight Is

ShadowLight helps you:
- Break down complex systems
- Structure abstract thinking
- Analyze relationships, constraints, and outcomes
- Explore problems methodically instead of intuitively

It is designed for **clarity, reasoning, and insight**, not automation.

---

## Step 1: Define What You’re Analyzing

Start with a single subject. Write it down clearly.

Examples:
- A system (technical, social, organizational)
- A strategic decision
- A research topic
- A complex idea or concept

Be specific. ShadowLight works best with clearly scoped problems.

---

## Step 2: Choose a Mode of Thinking

Open `docs/modes.md`.

Select the mode that best fits your goal, such as:
- Structural analysis
- Conceptual mapping
- Systems reasoning
- Constraint exploration

You are choosing **how** to think, not what to conclude.

---

## Step 3: Apply the Architecture

Open `docs/architecture.md`.

Use the architecture to organize your analysis:
- Identify components
- Define relationships
- Note assumptions
- Identify constraints and dependencies

This step turns vague ideas into structured understanding.

---

## Step 4: Reference Use Cases

Open `docs/use_cases.md`.

Use these examples to:
- See how ShadowLight is applied in different contexts
- Validate your approach
- Adjust your framing

Do not copy outcomes — adapt the process.

---

## Step 5: Iterate and Refine

ShadowLight is iterative.

As new insights emerge:
- Revisit your assumptions
- Adjust relationships
- Change modes if necessary

Clarity improves through repetition.

---

## Important Notes

- ShadowLight does **not** provide answers — it provides structure
- Conclusions are always the responsibility of the user
- The framework is most powerful when used deliberately and thoughtfully

ShadowLight is a lens.
