# ShadowLight Analytical Workflows

Analytical workflows describe how ShadowLight’s modes
are applied together to support real-world investigation
and decision-making.

Workflows are not rigid procedures.
They are repeatable patterns that guide disciplined reasoning
while allowing analyst judgment.

## Core Workflow Pattern

Most ShadowLight analyses follow a cyclical pattern:

1. Reconnaissance
2. Analysis
3. Adversarial Challenge
4. Synthesis
5. Re-entry (as needed)

This cycle may repeat multiple times as understanding evolves.

## Workflow 1: Exploratory Investigation

**Objective:** Understand an unfamiliar or poorly defined problem.

**Flow:**
- Reconnaissance → Analysis → Synthesis

**Description:**
The analyst begins by mapping the environment and identifying unknowns.
Preliminary hypotheses are formed and evaluated.
Findings are synthesized into an initial understanding.

**Common Use Cases:**
- Early-stage research
- New threat landscapes
- Ambiguous problem spaces

---

## Workflow 2: Hypothesis Validation

**Objective:** Test and refine an existing assumption or claim.

**Flow:**
- Analysis → Adversarial → Analysis → Synthesis

**Description:**
An initial hypothesis is explicitly challenged under adversarial assumptions.
Contradictions and weaknesses are explored before conclusions are finalized.

**Common Use Cases:**
- Attribution efforts
- Incident analysis
- Intelligence validation

---

## Workflow 3: Adversarial Stress Testing

**Objective:** Identify weaknesses, blind spots, or deception.

**Flow:**
- Reconnaissance → Adversarial → Analysis → Synthesis

**Description:**
The analyst assumes hostile intent and deceptive data from the outset.
Findings are validated through structured reasoning before synthesis.

**Common Use Cases:**
- Red-team analysis
- Disinformation detection
- Security posture evaluation

---

## Workflow 4: Strategic Synthesis

**Objective:** Translate complex findings into decision support.

**Flow:**
- Synthesis (with recursive reference to other modes)

**Description:**
Insights from prior analysis are consolidated into a coherent narrative,
including confidence levels and remaining uncertainties.

**Common Use Cases:**
- Executive briefings
- Strategic planning
- Knowledge transfer

## Analyst Judgment

ShadowLight workflows are intentionally non-prescriptive.
Analysts are expected to:
- Choose appropriate workflows
- Transition between modes intentionally
- Re-enter earlier stages as new information emerges

The strength of ShadowLight lies in disciplined flexibility,
not rigid automation.
