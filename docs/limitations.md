# ShadowLight Network — Limitations & Non‑Goals

## Purpose

This document defines the **explicit limitations** and **non‑goals** of ShadowLight Network.

It exists to:
- Prevent misuse
- Set correct expectations
- Preserve analytical integrity
- Clearly distinguish what ShadowLight **is not designed to do**

Clarity on limitations is a **core design feature**, not a weakness.

---

## Foundational Principle

ShadowLight Network prioritizes **analytical rigor over automation**.

As a result, it intentionally avoids roles that require certainty, authority, or autonomous control.

---

## Core Limitations

### 1. No Autonomous Decision‑Making

ShadowLight:
- Does **not** make final decisions
- Does **not** execute actions
- Does **not** assume responsibility for outcomes

All outputs are **advisory and analytical**.

Human judgment is always required.

---

### 2. No Guaranteed Correctness

ShadowLight:
- Works under uncertainty
- Produces probabilistic reasoning
- May surface competing or conflicting interpretations

It does **not** guarantee:
- Truth
- Completeness
- Optimal solutions

Confidence levels must always be interpreted cautiously.

---

### 3. No Real‑Time Control or Execution

ShadowLight is **not suitable** for:
- Real‑time control systems
- Safety‑critical automation
- Time‑sensitive operational execution

Its analytical depth trades speed for insight.

---

### 4. No Hidden Knowledge or Ground Truth Access

ShadowLight:
- Does not possess privileged or secret information
- Does not independently verify ground truth
- Relies on provided inputs and accessible context

All conclusions are bounded by available data.

---

### 5. No Replacement for Domain Expertise

ShadowLight:
- Does not replace subject‑matter experts
- Does not override professional judgment
- Does not substitute for legal, medical, financial, or technical authority

It **supports** expertise — it does not replace it.

---

### 6. Mode Bias Awareness

Each analytical mode introduces **intentional bias**:
- Defensive modes skew conservative
- Exploratory modes favor breadth
- Adversarial modes assume hostility

Outputs must be interpreted **in context of the active mode(s)**.

No mode is neutral.

---

### 7. Sensitivity to Input Quality

ShadowLight’s effectiveness is limited by:
- Incomplete information
- Poorly framed questions
- Hidden assumptions
- Ambiguous intent

Garbage in → sophisticated garbage out.

---

## Non‑Goals

The following are **explicit non‑goals** of ShadowLight Network.

### ❌ Fully Autonomous Intelligence
ShadowLight is not intended to operate independently of humans.

### ❌ Authority or Final Arbiter
ShadowLight does not declare truths, verdicts, or definitive answers.

### ❌ Behavioral Control System
ShadowLight does not enforce behavior, compliance, or policy.

### ❌ Predictive Oracle
ShadowLight does not reliably predict the future or outcomes.

### ❌ Surveillance or Monitoring Tool
ShadowLight is not designed for continuous monitoring or tracking.

---

## Ethical Boundary

ShadowLight is designed to:
- Encourage reflection
- Surface uncertainty
- Challenge assumptions

It intentionally avoids:
- Manipulation
- Coercion
- Persuasion framed as certainty

Analytical power must remain **transparent and accountable**.

---

## Managing Limitations

Best practices include:
- Explicitly stating assumptions
- Using multiple modes
- Validating outputs externally
- Maintaining human oversight
- Treating outputs as hypotheses, not answers

Limitations are mitigated through **process**, not technology alone.

---

## Stability of Scope

ShadowLight’s limitations are **structural**, not temporary.

Future versions may improve:
- Clarity
- Robustness
- Adaptability

But these core boundaries are expected to remain.

---

## Summary

ShadowLight Network is intentionally constrained.

> It does not decide.  
> It does not command.  
> It does not guarantee.

It exists to **help humans think better in complex, uncertain environments** — and nothing more.
