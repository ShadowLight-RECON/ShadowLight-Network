# Contributing to ShadowLight Network

Thank you for your interest in contributing to ShadowLight Network.

ShadowLight is a precision‑driven analytical framework. Contributions are welcome, but they must align with the project’s philosophy, scope, and standards.

This document explains how to contribute effectively.

---

## Project Philosophy

ShadowLight Network prioritizes:

- Conceptual clarity over feature volume
- Structured reasoning over speculation
- Intentional design over rapid iteration
- Documentation‑first development

If your contribution strengthens these principles, it is likely welcome.

---

## What You Can Contribute

Meaningful contributions include:

- Improvements to documentation clarity or structure
- Refinements to architectural descriptions
- Thoughtful additions to modes or analytical behavior
- Corrections, consistency fixes, or precision enhancements
- Well‑reasoned proposals aligned with ShadowLight’s scope

Low‑effort, speculative, or unfocused contributions will not be accepted.

---

## Contribution Guidelines

Before contributing, ensure that your work:

- Aligns with the existing philosophy and design intent
- Is clearly written, structured, and precise
- Avoids introducing unnecessary complexity
- Does not expand scope without justification
- Respects existing terminology and conceptual boundaries

Every contribution should explain **why** it exists, not just **what** it adds.

2. Create a focused branch  
   `feature/short-description`

3. Make your changes
4. Ensure documentation remains consistent
5. Submit a Pull Request

## Pull Request Review

All pull requests are reviewed by maintainers.

Review criteria include:

- Alignment with project philosophy
- Clarity and precision
- Long‑term maintainability
- Conceptual integrity

Maintainers may request revisions or decline contributions that do not meet these standards.

---

## Scope Control

ShadowLight Network has defined boundaries.

Contributions that attempt to:

- Reframe the project’s purpose
- Introduce unrelated tooling
- Dilute conceptual rigor
- Turn ShadowLight into a general‑purpose system

will be declined.

This is intentional.

---

## Communication Standards

All contributors are expected to communicate professionally and respectfully.

Focused, constructive discussion is required at all times.

---

## Final Note

ShadowLight Network is built deliberately.

If you are contributing, you are helping refine a system — not experimenting on one.

Quality matters. Precision matters. Intent matters.
